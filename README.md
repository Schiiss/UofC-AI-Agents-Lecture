## 🤖 Step 6: OCR the Movies

1. Navigate to `scripts/ocr_movies`.
2. Set the following configs:

   ![Upload to Volume](assets/ocr_script.png)

   - `destinationTableName`: `movies.movies_db.ocr`
   - `limit`: `100`
   - `partitionCount`: `4`
   - `sourceVolumePath`: `/Volumes/movies/movies_db/pdfs`

> **Note:**  
> This script reads files from storage, processes them (using AI for PDFs/images), and stores results in a new table. Errors are tracked, and all processed documents are combined for easy analysis.

3. Click **Run**:

   ![Run OCR Script](assets/run_ocr_script.png)

> ⏳ *Processing may take a few minutes. When finished, you'll have a table with extracted text from your movie PDFs.*

---

## 🔍 Step 7: Explore the OCR Table

1. Go to the **SQL Editor** tab and create a new query:

   ![Create OCR Table Query](assets/create_ocr_table_sql_query.png)

2. Use this prompt for AI:  
   > *"write me a SQL query that returns all rows in movies.movies_db.ocr"*

   ![AI Generated OCR Query](assets/ocr_sql_query_ai_assistant.png)

   The AI should generate:

   sql
   SELECT *
   FROM movies.movies_db.ocr
   

### 📝 Questions to Consider

- What does the data look like?
- Does the OCR content match the website?

## 🧠 Step 8: Extract Metadata Using AI

- Create a new query and use this prompt for AI:  
  > *"using the ai_extract function to extract director, year_filmed, cast on the table movies.movies_db.ocr on the text column, create a column for each and write the output to movies.movies_db.movie_metadata"*
